<![CDATA[ <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kvUxCePPMcrCCdoSXTJYsg.jpeg" /></figure><h4>We’re now officially and totally integrated into Wired. But we won’t be gone.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/216/1*l1rwI8JqPwqroFjU9Xbqfw.png" /></figure><p>Dear Backchannel readers,</p><p>Steven here. First, the news: Starting with the new year, Backchannel will be fully integrated into <a href="https://medium.com/u/ecdcb63e1a76">WIRED</a>. While this means that there won’t be a weekly drop of Backchannel stories and columns — and we won’t be producing them from solely within a five-person unit — you’ll be still seeing those stories and reading the same writers who produced them when you visit the WIRED site. In fact, Backchannel will live on in the form of a new section on wired.com, which will launch in the coming weeks. More on that to come.</p><p>In the meantime, you will still be able to read stories from <a href="https://medium.com/u/9eda8914b544">Jessi Hempel</a> and me on<a href="http://wired.com/"> wired.com</a>, and also in the print edition (though I will be writing less this year because of a book leave). Backchannel editors <a href="https://medium.com/u/bc1e3e60af88">Sandra Upson</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/5a217bc1e95b">Alexis Sobel Fitts</a> will transfer their skills to wired.com, and our associate editor <a href="https://medium.com/u/98aaa0cfb4be">Miranda Katz</a> will become a web producer for the site. All of us are excited to join the WIRED family, and we may even convince our new colleagues to run some meetings in the holocratic style we learned at Medium.</p><p>For those of you who follow Backchannel, this news probably won’t be a shock. Since we moved to the WIRED platform last June, it’s been clear that many — if not all — of our stories would have been appropriate for WIRED, and in some cases vice versa. It turns out that our vision of the tech world is pretty close to that of WIRED’s new editor, <a href="https://medium.com/u/e66076508d37">Nicholas Thompson</a>. It simply made sense to join forces.</p><p>Now, some personal notes. The three-plus years since I left WIRED to start Backchannel on Medium have been the most gratifying of my career. I loved working with a small team of smart editors and writers to produce high quality stories that we hoped might raise the bar of tech journalism. (Also, during our Medium years, I got an amazing inside glimpse of life at a buzzy internet startup.) But I am also thrilled to be returning to WIRED, which has been a writing home for me since its beginning. (I wrote its <a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/">second cover story</a>, about cypherpunks and the crypto revolution that’s still in the news.) Though Backchannel is no longer a separate entity — and, yeah, I admit that’s bittersweet — I’m also proud that its DNA will productively mingle with the greatest tech magazine on the planet. Also, keeping the Backchannel name in circulation means we won’t have to throw out all those stickers we printed.</p><p>My eternal thanks to my wonderful coworkers: Sandra, who’s been my executive editor and flame-keeper since the beginning; Jessi, our brilliant writer and editorial director; Alexis, whose intelligence and editorial mastery raised our own; and Miranda, whose skills and logistical savvy made her indispensable to our operation. Thanks also to <a href="https://medium.com/u/bfe2a121fd94">Scott Rosenberg</a> for ably filling in for much of this year, and to <a href="https://medium.com/u/a44972f6a138">Ricki Harris</a>, who dove into deep editorial waters straight out of school and stayed afloat. We are also very much indebted to Nick Thompson, a constant supporter of Backchannel, who led a warm welcome to our people from the entire WIRED staff.</p><p>I consider myself blessed to be back in the neon mothership for the magazine’s 25th anniversary year. And it’s so much sweeter that the great Backchannel team is along for the ride.</p><p>Happy New Year!</p><p>— Steven</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/46/1*2EunS2DD8Xh46K_4upK_yw.png" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5ee3ea72fedb" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/news-from-backchannel-5ee3ea72fedb">News From Backchannel</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel">Backchannel</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h4>Starting mid-June, we’ll publish even more of the work you care about in a new weekly format.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pN0MK4BJOjqeZpIetdClYw.jpeg" /><figcaption>(Illustration by Laurent Hrybyk)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/216/1*l1rwI8JqPwqroFjU9Xbqfw.png" /></figure><p><strong>Dear <em>Backchannel</em> readers,</strong></p><p>Last summer, <em>Backchannel</em> joined Condé Nast as part of the Wired Media Group. For all of the reasons you imagine, it made sense. Though we have our own distinct personality, we’re a lot like <em>Wired</em>. In fact, <a href="https://medium.com/u/2fff2fb3e70a">Steven</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/9eda8914b544">Jessi</a> both hail from <em>Wired</em>. And like the editors there, we have a deep conviction that accurately reported news presented with context is a critical tool for understanding the future.</p><p>And now, a year later, we’re closing the circle. <em>Backchannel</em> is<strong> </strong>joining forces with our sister publication. Starting June 21, we will begin publishing <em>Backchannel</em> as a weekly digital magazine on wired.com. As players in a news cycle that’s rapidly approaching light speed, we believe our work will stand out more as a weekly event — an occasion — than as yet more fodder for the daily churn. And now we’ll be hosted on <em>Wired’s</em> site, rather than on Medium. We will still be editorially independent, of course, and our staff is unchanged.</p><blockquote>Follow Backchannel: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/backchnnl/">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/backchnnl">Twitter</a></blockquote><p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong> Things are about to get a lot better. We’ll still bring you our signature brand of informed writing by us and opinionated pieces by insiders like <a href="https://medium.com/u/bd6802cfefdf">Karen Wickre</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/92958ea4f86a">Susan Crawford</a>. But now we’ll work even more closely with our <em>Wired</em> colleagues to produce meaningful stories, and to distribute them across all the platforms where readers look for informed commentary on technology’s growing impact on our lives.</p><p><strong>Okay, but why are we leaving Medium? </strong>The short answer is that we love the platform and the thoughtful community that has coalesced around our publication because of Medium. But in the time since <em>Backchannel</em> launched, Medium has shifted its business strategy, and it’s no longer as focused on helping publications like ours profit. To bring you the tech reporting that matters most, we must fund it. Under new editor Nick Thompson, <em>Wired</em> is committed to figuring out how to make a robust business off of thoughtful, meaty journalism. We share this vision and believe that by bringing our publications even closer together, we’ll be doubling down on <em>Backchannel’s</em> original mission.</p><p>You’ll still find us at <a href="https://backchannel.com/">backchannel.com</a>, as well as on <a href="https://twitter.com/backchnnl">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/backchnnl/">Facebook</a>. The best way to stay informed, however, is to <a href="https://www.wired.com/newsletter?name=backchannel">sign up to receive <em>Backchannel</em> weekly in your inbox</a>.</p><h4><strong>Please note: Even if you are getting this current newsletter through Medium, <em>you still need to </em></strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/newsletter?name=backchannel"><strong><em>make this signup</em>.</strong></a></h4><p>Let us know what you think: You can always reach us at <a href="mailto:editors@backchannel.com">editors@backchannel.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Last, a note of thanks.</strong> <em>Backchannel</em> has come to life because of you. Your comments, highlights, and story ideas have pushed our thinking and transformed our publication into a collaborative endeavor. We look forward to bringing you many more stories you’ll love in the months to come.</p><p>Along with senior editor <a href="https://medium.com/u/5a217bc1e95b">Alexis Sobel Fitts</a> and editorial associate <a href="https://medium.com/u/98aaa0cfb4be">Miranda Katz</a>, we remain gratefully yours —</p><p>Jessi, Steven, and Sandra</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/697/1*IElHPefKAFnb65dyxb7vQg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/46/1*2EunS2DD8Xh46K_4upK_yw.png" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dcb693c26ac0" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/backchannel-is-moving-to-wired-dcb693c26ac0">Backchannel Is Moving to Wired</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel">Backchannel</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h4>Everything is looking up, according to Mary Meeker, even if global smartphone growth is trending down.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-cGwi8CSuAwJOYK_K6W8Ug.jpeg" /><figcaption>(Bloomberg / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/201/1*8Uw-BCtPVnkYQaKanVdemw.png" /></figure><p><strong>Hi Backchannel readers, </strong>it’s Jessi.</p><p>On Wednesday, Kleiner Perkins investor Mary Meeker delivered her annual internet trends report at Code Conference, the annual south-of-Los Angeles gathering that feels as much like a summer camp reunion as a tech confab. Meeker always presents early in the morning of the second day. To tech newbies, her presentation must seem like one of the strangest rituals in the industry — a core dump of stats, charts, and headlines, dense with exotic acronyms and hockey-stick curves. But it’s ambrosia to tech business insiders. At Code, attendees tend to meander in and out of sessions depending on the popularity of the speaker, but the seats are always filled for Meeker’s unveiling.</p><p>Basically, Meeker is delivering tech’s State of the Union address. To wit: Meeker’s report not only captures the internet moment in time, but also sets the agenda for anyone attempting to get in on the next big thing. Missing it could be missing a stake in the next unicorn.</p><blockquote>Follow Backchannel: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/backchnnl/">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/backchnnl">Twitter</a></blockquote><p>This year, after explaining that her presentation was meant to be read, not heard, Meeker raced through her 355 slides in 33 minutes with all of the charisma of Apple’s Siri—picking up speed as she went. Every year, she adds more slides. In her first presentation, delivered in 2001, she had just 25. This year, no one seemed to care about her presentation style; they were too busy scrutinizing her data — and <a href="https://twitter.com/dens">tweeting the gems</a>.</p><p>By now, you’ve likely come across <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends">her biggest bets</a> on, oh, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnosta/2017/06/01/mary-meeker-is-bold-on-digital-health/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/">every</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/mary-meeker-internet-trends-2017/">tech</a> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mary-meeker-internet-trends-2017-report-india-top-highlights-points-to-note-mobile-growth-4683709/">blog</a> you’ve read. She says global smartphone growth is slowing, though it’s surging in India. Netflix is growing, while TV viewership continues to decline. Voice really is a big deal — one in five mobile queries were made by voice, and, she says, accuracy is now at 95 percent. She’s bullish on all sorts of things, like the rise of tech in China, the importance of immigrants to the industry, and the coming boom in healthcare tech.</p><p>But why exactly does Meeker’s data dump resonate so strongly? Because she’s one of a kind. Meeker’s been at this forever. As an analyst at Morgan Stanley, she had an unwavering conviction that all business would digitize. In late 1995, when just 35 million people were online, she published <em>The Internet Report</em>, which quickly became a bible for anyone trying to grok the web. You could buy your own 322-page copy at your local Barnes &amp; Noble. In it, she predicted rather forcibly that within five years, 150 million would surf the ‘net. (In fact, more than twice that many people were online by 2000. Even Meeker could not be optimistic enough about the biggest sea change in our time.)</p><p>In those heady internet years, Meeker was the top-ranked industry analyst working with Morgan Stanley’s top banker, Ruth Porat. And though she was certainly party to the stock boosterism that landed many of her peers in trouble in the early aughts, she truly believed in the potential of the companies she backed. Unlike peers such as Henry Blodget or Frank Quattrone, she was never indicted or fined. She continued as Morgan Stanley’s rockstar internet analyst until 2010, when she joined Kleiner Perkins. These days, Meeker leads growth stage investments for the firm. (Porat, too, eventually moved to tech; she’s now Alphabet’s chief financial officer.)</p><p>Meeker is not a seer. She hasn’t been right about everything. But for decades, she has pored through voluminous amounts of data and lived the history of the web, and she scrutinizes all of her inputs to make educated guesses about its future. That’s the reason why, in the weeks to come, founders and investors alike will slip her slides into their own funding requests and board presentations.</p><p>And already, they’re making bets on how many slides she’ll slip into next year’s presentation. 400, anyone?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/208/1*BGVyuICrNQCb-jSPyyUscw.png" /></figure><h4>This week on Backchannel:</h4><p>The Melt had cash, technology, and some of Silicon Valley’s finest minds — yet <a href="https://backchannel.com/how-the-trendiest-grilled-cheese-venture-got-burnt-aa627b0c7ae1">it failed to disrupt the humble sandwich</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/u/f0cf7299365e">Bianca Bosker</a> on how the trendiest grilled cheese venture got burnt.</p><p>Steve Jobs had a vision to resurrect pre-tech Silicon Valley in his new HQ.

<![CDATA[ <h4>Are we in a bubble? Why has Uber’s story spun out of control? The answers hinge less on facts and more on the hidden physics of Narrative Gravity.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zfqJFVPh-pqNb6aFhqn35g.gif" /><figcaption>Image by <a href="http://medium.com/@zachgrosser">Zach Grosser</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*t6Jsgbu_bU84ZZkgxw8G8A.png" /></figure><p><strong>Things we know to be true:</strong> John McCain is a maverick. The New England Patriots are cheaters. Apple can’t innovate without Steve Jobs.</p><p>But wait a second. How do we actually “know” these things? And what makes them “true”?</p><p>The answers reveal something fundamental about how companies and people rise and fall in the eyes of the media. Once a narrative sets in — such as “maverick” in a good case, or “cheater” in a bad one — it becomes very hard to break. But it can be done.</p><p>The warping effects of narratives are everywhere, from Uber to Snapchat to Elon Musk. Before we get to those examples, it helps to start with a tale that begins — as so many tech stories do — with fear of a bubble.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png" /></figure><p><strong>In October 2015,</strong> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/mutual-funds-mark-down-dropbox-holdings">The Information</a> reported that BlackRock and Fidelity mutual funds each marked down the value of their holdings in Dropbox. The markdowns implied a 20 to 30 percent decrease in the company’s valuation, from $10 billion to around $7.5 billion.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startups-feel-an-ipo-chill-1445309822"><em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s subsequent report</a> presented the markdown as trouble for Dropbox and a sign of weakness for the 100+ “unicorn” private companies with valuations over $1 billion. The public market’s reception of recent tech company IPOs portended similar dangers for unicorns. As the <em>Journal</em> put it:</p><blockquote>At least 11 of 49 venture-capital-backed U.S. technology companies with IPOs since the start of 2014 traded below the per-share value where they last raised money as a private company.</blockquote><p>A media frenzy followed: <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/20bda38c-874c-11e5-9f8c-a8d619fa707c.html">The <em>Financial Times</em> reported</a> that Fidelity had written down the value of its stake in Snapchat by 25 percent. <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/17/mutual-fund-markdowns-startups/">Fortune noted</a> that T. Rowe Price and The Hartford had marked down more than a dozen private companies, including Pinterest and Evernote. The markdowns, according to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/fidelity-writes-down-value-of-snapchat-holding-by-25-">Bloomberg</a>, were “the latest evidence that private technology companies are losing some of their luster.”</p><blockquote><em>Follow Backchannel: </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/backchnnl/"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/backchnnl"><em>Twitter</em></a></blockquote><p>You may have missed it, but 10 days later the <em>Journal</em> published a story titled “<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/mutual-funds-flail-at-valuing-hot-startups-like-uber-1446174018">Mutual Funds Flail at Valuing Hot Startups like Uber</a>.” They noted that “prices for hot private companies are hard to set and can vary widely,” and “no one knows what those investments are actually worth.” In many instances, the <em>Journal</em> found the same company’s valuation varied widely across different fund managers. Most of the funds’ revisions — up or down — were based in part on guesswork and general fluctuations in the stock market.</p><p>So which was it? Were mutual funds a reliable arbiter of private company valuations? Or did the markdowns show fund managers weren’t credible when it comes to valuing unicorns?</p><p>I don’t pretend to know the answer. To me, the more interesting question is about narratives. Why did the same fact — mutual funds marking down unicorns — become widely accepted as an indictment of the latter’s businesses, and not the former’s math?</p><p>Surprise! I have a metaphor.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png" /></figure><h4><strong>The Law of Narrative Gravity</strong></h4><p>The theory of gravity says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">objects attract other objects in the universe using a force that is directly proportional to their masses</a>. The greater an object’s mass, the greater the gravitational force. (Like so many origin stories, including those in Silicon Valley, the one where Isaac Newton came up with his famous theory when he saw an apple fall from a tree is probably a myth.)</p><p>The Law of Narrative Gravity posits that the public and press are drawn to narratives, and the more widely accepted (or massive) a narrative, the more it attracts and shapes the perception of facts.</p><p>Which brings us back to unicorns and mutual fund markdowns. Which narrative was more prevalent in the fall of 2015?</p><ol><li>“Mutual funds often have imperfect information, which makes it difficult for them to value private companies.”</li><li>“We’re in another tech bubble.”</li></ol><p>“Another tech bubble” was the subject of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/26/the-tech-industry-is-in-denial-but-the-bubble-is-about-to-burst/">insane</a> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/05/investing/tech-bubble-snapchat/">amount</a> of <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/09/26/tech-bubble-venture-capital/">reporting</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/the-great-silicon-valley-bubble-machine/409738/">analysis</a>, and <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/09/tech-bubble-this-is-money-in-your-mattress-time.html">speculation</a> at the time (to say nothing of the are-we-or-aren’t-we-in-a-bubble debate that’s been popular for 15 years), and it warped journalistic spacetime, bending stories to fit the narrative.</p><p>Here, again, is that sentence from the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>about the challenges of private tech companies after going public:</p><blockquote>At least <strong>11 of 49 </strong>venture-capital-backed U.S. technology companies with IPOs since the start of 2014 <strong>traded below the per-share value </strong>where they last raised money as a private company.</blockquote><p>In other words, only 22 percent of venture-backed tech companies are worth less since going public. That seems…reasonable?</p><p>If the goal was to instead support a bull market theory, the reverse metric would hold: “at least 38 of 49” such tech companies had traded <em>above</em><strong><em> </em></strong>their earlier value — or 78 percent. If I were a private tech company looking to go public, I’d take those odds. But “the vast majority of tech companies have done well since going public” is irreconcilable with the bubble narrative, so it’s not the story. Facts that might directly rebut the narrative can be easily dismissed.</p><p>In fact, only one month after the first reports surfaced of Fidelity’s unicorn markdowns, <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/30/unicorn-volatility-fidelity-dropbox-snapchat/">Fortune reported</a> that Fidelity managers had marked <em>up</em> shares of both Dropbox and Snapchat. But you’d never know it from the news. According to a Google search at the time, the markdown news cycle generated 160 articles. The markup news cycle? Just five.</p><p>Narrative gravity is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>, “the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one’s beliefs.” But with narratives, it’s less about personal beliefs and more of a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bandwagon-effect.asp">bandwagon effect</a>, where everyone processes and interprets information through a framework that is both easily digestible and broadly accepted. Narrative gravity is <a href="https://backchannel.com/how-the-tech-press-forces-a-narrative-on-companies-it-covers-5f89fdb7793e#.cg7qpb7yt">what makes a startup’s story clock tick</a>.</p><p>Narrative gravity exists beyond tech. It’s why Senator John McCain is still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-john-mccain-a-maverick/">considered a maverick</a> and why Tiger Woods’ big comeback is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tiger+woods+comeback&amp;oq=tiger+woods+comeback&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3748j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">always right around the corner</a>. The gravitational pull of a prevailing narrative is hard to resist.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png" /></figure><h4><strong>Negative Narratives — The Black Holes of Media</strong></h4><p>Narrative gravity is one of the strongest forces in the universe, especially when it comes to negative news cycles.</p><p>The worst negative news cycles occur when a story reinforces an already-bad perception of a company, an established negative narrative built from previous news. The story gets pulled towards the popular narrative like a black hole — even if the new facts are ambiguous.</p><p>Take Uber during the immigration order protests. This January, after the White House issued its executive order, thousands of people rallied at airports around the country to protest the ban. During the protests, the New York Taxi Drivers Alliance <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTWA">announced it would not take any pickups</a> at JFK Airport, in solidarity with immigrants and to protest the order. The lack of taxis meant high demand for Uber at JFK. So the company <a href="https://twitter.com/Uber_NYC/status/825502908926066688">turned off surge pricing</a> to (presumably) avoid the sorts of customer backlash and <a href="http://gothamist.com/2013/12/16/uber_surge_pricing.php">horrible press</a> it received when previous high-demand events — like winter storms or New Year’s Eve — drove prices up by more than 500 percent.</p><p>But since perception of Uber is starkly — and rightly — negative (for <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johanabhuiyan/uber-is-investigating-its-top-new-york-executive-for-privacy">many</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/18/7240215/uber-exec-casually-threatens-sarah-lacy-with-smear-campaign">well-deserved</a> <a href="https://pando.com/2014/02/27/we-call-that-boob-er-the-four-most-awful-things-travis-kalanick-said-in-his-gq-profile/">reasons</a>, even before the <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber">sexual harassment</a> news and everything else over the past two weeks), it got no benefit of the doubt. The facts were caught in the powerful gravitational pull of the “Uber is bad” narrative and were interpreted by users as <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/29/uber-immigration-protests/">strike-breaking profiteering</a>, as opposed to what it probably was: a clumsy attempt to <em>avoid</em> profiting from the strike via surge pricing. Lyft, like Uber, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/01/29/uber-triggers-protest-for-not-supporting-taxi-strike-against-refugee-ban">also continued to pick up passengers</a> at JFK during the strike, though there was no ensuing #DeleteLyft campaign.</p><p>Six weeks later, the Uber star has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova">exploded and collapsed</a>. They have put themselves in such a bad place that there’s a perpetual negative cycle: a barrage of stories fueled, in part, by having the world’s leading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html">journalists</a> and <a href="http://www.recode.net/2017/2/22/14700114/is-uber-lost">columnists</a> pore over the company’s every move, develop new sources, chase each other’s stories, and uncover previously undisclosed facts. And every bad story looks even worse in light of the previous ones, creating an ever more massive narrative.</p><p>Incidentally, when your narrative is positive, certain facts are forgiven. For example, the prevalent Elon Musk narrative is that he’s a crazy futurist who wants to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/elon-musk-colonize-mars/">colonize Mars</a> and build a<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601417/the-unbelievable-reality-of-the-impossible-hyperloop/"> vacuum-tube train</a>, and who thinks <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation">humanity is living in a simulation</a>. Musk is also a member of President Trump’s business advisory council, for which he’s received relatively little backlash. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-trump-advisory-council.html">forced to withdraw</a> from the controversial group after days of bad press and public pressure. Though Musk’s membership didn’t fit a negative narrative about Musk — if anything, it advanced the idea that he’s a bit mad — Kalanick’s participation hit the “Uber is bad” sweet spot. He had to step down.</p><p>Yes, life is awesome in the positive narrative universe. Snapchat planning to set its IPO price below its last private round? A <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/832192786178908161">mature decision</a> that shows focus! (Never mind that for other pre-IPOs it’s a <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/06/square-valuation-ipo/">sign of weakness</a>.) When you’re far away from the force of negative narratives, you can tell your story free from their destructive influence.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AwTXMT2omVX-1Q8BM3cD-A.png" /></figure><h4><strong>How To Escape a Negative Narrative</strong></h4><p>Inside an actual black hole, the gravitational effects are so strong that nothing can escape it and the laws of physics as we know them cease to exist.</p><p>Escaping a narrative black hole is not impossible — though it is hard. Here are the laws of physics that still operate:</p><h4>1. Never do anything to remotely reinforce your negative narrative.</h4><p>The worst thing you can do when your company’s in a bad narrative is prove to everyone that what they already think of you is correct. Never, ever validate someone’s negative perception of you, fair or unfair.</p><p>When you’re in the black hole, every business decision your company makes must include a consideration of how it will be interpreted given the prevailing narrative. This is crucial: Any fact even remotely capable of being interpreted consistently with the narrative will be sucked into its orbit. Always be on the lookout for how you might fall into this trap, and keep your company’s actions as far away from it as you possibly can. No <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcDqBerTfTE">own goals</a>.</p><h4>2. Find a wormhole to a faraway part of the narrative universe.</h4><p>One cool theory about black holes is that they might open up a bridge to another part of the universe: You fall into a black hole, only to take a spacetime shortcut (known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole">wormhole</a>) to somewhere billions of miles away.</p><p>Finding a completely different, even distant audience for your message is a great strategy when you’re stuck in a negative narrative. The tech press only wants to talk about how the economics of your business are bad? Pitch <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/food/high-school-students-delivery-apps">interesting customer stories</a> to consumer outlets — they probably don’t care about <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/03/22/doordash-raises-127-million-in-down-round/">your financials</a>. The important thing is to get out of your bubble and talk to people who either don’t know (or don’t care) about what’s consuming those who follow you day to day.</p><h4>3. Be patient and vigilant — narrative gravity is there even if you can’t see it.</h4><p>When you’re in a crisis, there’s often an expectation that you can explain your way out of it. (Or, if the tweets have died down, it’s tempting to believe that maybe the narrative’s over.) This is super dangerous. Attempting to tell a turnaround story too soon <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3033412/internet-of-things/back-to-square-one">often</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/dropbox-is-struggling-and-competitors-are-catching-up">backfires</a>. Remember: Narrative gravity pulls everything back toward the negative storyline. There’s no risk for a reporter to tell a story that validates what readers may already believe. On the other hand, it takes real guts to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/miguelhelft/2016/11/04/a-year-after-forbes-declared-there-is-no-unicorn-bubble-how-did-we-do/#64ba199e6839">swim against the tide</a>.</p><p>This does not mean you should go into a bunker, which can exacerbate the situation by creating a vacuum that everyone but you fills with information. It means you shouldn’t swing for the fences with a “this’ll fix it!” short-term plan, or assume that people have forgotten the last thing they heard about you. You have to play a long game, measured in months—and sometimes years — as opposed to days or weeks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook#Privacy_issues">Privacy issues</a> were once a staple of Facebook coverage. It took Square (the company where I work) more than two years to shake <a href="http://www.recode.net/2017/2/23/14703104/jack-dorsey-square-thriving">perceived financial issues</a>. Angelina Jolie went from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10899833/The-remarkable-reinvention-of-Angelina-Jolie.html">homewrecker to humanitarian</a> over a decade. Reputational change doesn’t happen overnight.</p><h4>4. After the collapse, the only thing that matters is to rebuild.</h4><p>When everything you do, right or wrong, is being sucked into a narrative black hole, your credibility usually goes with it. Typical statements and gestures no longer work. At best, people are skeptical and dismiss your efforts because they question your motives. At worst, they impute your actions with malice and assume you are lying to them.</p><p>To rebuild trust, you must be clear and comprehensive in your explanation, emphatic in your commitment to do right, and ready to back it up with proof. If your messenger isn’t credible, you have to replace them with someone who is. No mealy-mouthed half measures: Every single thing your company does publicly must be consistent and dedicated to addressing your problem. Any action that is not in support of rebuilding credibility is a waste of your time and might even compound your problem.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_dJHHAJFu3i68xcQskPWyg.png" /></figure><p><strong>So pay attention</strong> to narrative gravity. It can be weak or strong, and it can warp the way you see things. But unlike actual gravity, it isn’t rocket science. 🚀</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uW_l9n54f47SZbPxRBEq2A.png" /></figure><p><a href="https://backchannel.com/how-the-tech-press-forces-a-narrative-on-companies-it-covers-5f89fdb7793e">How the Tech Press Forces a Narrative on Companies it Covers</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=41dca28a1f7d" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/the-invisible-force-that-warps-what-you-read-in-the-news-41dca28a1f7d">The Invisible Force That Warps What You Read in the News</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel">Backchannel</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ /></figure><p><strong>On January 2, 2015,</strong> I wrote a viral post entitled “<a href="https://backchannel.com/a-teenagers-view-on-social-media-1df945c09ac6#.vu0fd9a6b">A Teenager’s View on Social Media</a>,” in which I dissected popular apps and what I thought about them. It got over one million views. Many people have asked me to write a follow-up or, at the very least, an update. I haven’t felt there was a dramatic enough shift to warrant a new post…until now.</p><blockquote>Follow Backchannel: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/backchnnl/">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/backchnnl">Twitter</a></blockquote><p>I will start this post off with transparency, since it influences my view of the landscape. I am a 21-year-old male attending The University of Texas at Austin. I am heavily invested in social media and I try out all of the latest social apps whenever I can. I really love following and paying attention to the trends surrounding social media, often observing both my own and my network’s usage of it. I have previously interned at Facebook and Google, but the views in this post are my own and any commentary about product feature requests or these companies’ product roadmaps are purely speculative. No hot scoops here. :)</p><p>Similar to the previous post, I will break this down by network and what I’ve observed over the past two years.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Vyb3FyACdbzipaW-msEURA.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*sanRcUEjFLInCj9oShV49Q.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Facebook</h3><p>Facebook was definitely my hottest take in my first article, when I announced, “It’s dead to us.” It seemed like such a stale social network, with mostly publications and distant friends populating the News Feed. However, sharing among my friends has recently increased dramatically due to a few main factors I’ve noticed:</p><ul><li>Users are better educated on how to tag people in the comments of posts and how to share posts, which has helped viral content spread.</li><li>The emphasis on videos over text has made the platform more engaging and shareable, since videos are (currently) one of the most engaging formats.</li><li>The emergence of “Weird Facebook” — Facebook pages and groups that are focused on memes or other niche topics.</li></ul><p>Messenger has also become a valuable tool. I know plenty of people who prefer Messenger to traditional texting. It’s the communication platform of choice when I (as an iPhone owner) have to message an Android user.</p><p>Facebook Live has also become increasingly influential among my peers. I know at least a dozen friends who have gone Live in the past month. For now the feature still seems fairly niche, with a ton of barriers to user participation (people often don’t have enough content for a continued stream, so they shut it down within a minute or two). Also, the fact that going Live (seemingly) notifies your entire Friend List can make for a pretty stressful process with a lot of pressure.</p><p>But for my friends and me, Facebook is still <strong>not</strong> the dominant social network many people see it as. If people meet at a party, they’re more likely to add each other on Snapchat or Instagram. That isn’t to say people don’t friend one another on Facebook anymore — they definitely do — but rather that other networks dominate the conversation. Facebook is seen as a fairly formal means of connecting. If a friend of mine meets a guy at a party, she doesn’t want him to see all of this information about her that’s on Facebook. She prefers Snapchat because it opens a line of communication, gives a more honest look into a person’s life, and is just more lightweight as a platform to talk on.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HwWGaBfcoKYK2sQmn27Nnw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*dNatzY7fj9CTAlb2C-TIdg.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Instagram</h3><p>Instagram is still one of the most used social media outlets for my age group. I would argue that it isn’t <strong><em>the</em></strong><em> </em>most, since Snapchat has definitely acquired more influence over the years. Many of the observations I made two years ago still hold true:</p><ul><li>I’m not terrified if I like something on Instagram that it will show up in someone’s feed (though, I’m not really as worried about that on Facebook as I used to be).</li><li>There isn’t pressure to follow back on Instagram, making the content inherently more curated.</li><li>The content on Instagram itself is generally higher quality.</li><li>Instagram <em>still </em>(which is honestly surprising) hasn’t been flooded with the older generation yet.</li><li>People often don’t post as much content on Instagram but, with the new algorithm (which I’ll get to shortly), even if they did it wouldn’t matter as much.</li></ul><p>The one thing that has changed is my stance on links on Instagram. I believe links should be added to Instagram, given that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/03/instagrams-new-algorithm-that-puts-the-best-posts-first-goes-live-for-all/">the release of their new algorithm</a> would prevent link spamming, and given that the integration Instagram did for links on Stories (having users simply swipe up from a Story in order to visit a link) was brilliant.</p><p>Speaking of Instagram Stories, I’m actually a huge fan of this feature. I don’t have too many friends who post on it, causing it to mostly be populated by celebrities or brands. However, the organization and implementation of Stories is genius, making me want to engage with it anyways. Their unobtrusive spot at the top of the feed, sorted based on the engagement you’ve had with the Instagram accounts, and the navigation of the Stories themselves is brilliant. Plus, tagging friends in the posts on Stories and adding links have both been integrated terrifically.</p><p>The content on the Stories often mimics what users see in the feed — highly curated, often artistic photos. That being said, you won’t see the sort of raw view into someone’s life on Instagram as you would on Snapchat. Snapchat is still a much more personal network and is the only place where I feel like I can be myself when I post. But I’ll get to Snapchat later.</p><p>Instagram’s Direct Messaging has also improved dramatically, mainly because of the addition of the share button on posts and the (seemingly forced) inclusion of comment tags → DMs. Whenever you tag a friend in the comments on Instagram, it defaults to sending them a message of the image, rather than leaving an actual comment with the tag. I don’t have conversations with anyone over Instagram DM, mainly just sharing photos back and forth on the platform, which I think is the perfect use case for it.</p><p>My views regarding Instagram’s Live functionality are the same as my views on Facebook’s, though I would feel more comfortable using Instagram’s because it deletes automatically.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HwWGaBfcoKYK2sQmn27Nnw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*CL3khO_S8zEN5J6hXHRcFQ.png" /></figure><h3>Twitter</h3><p>Many people in my immediate circle hardly use Twitter at all, but I am aware of other groups within my age bracket who use it as their primary platform to connect and share. I’ve personally grown to appreciate Twitter much more. It’s a terrific place to express your views and meet like-minded individuals from around the globe. However, a few problems really plague Twitter that I think are inhibiting it from growing more:</p><ul><li>Harassment, spamming (just go to any political person’s Twitter), and lack of a transparent review process (at least compared to other sites, such as Facebook).</li><li>Difficulty with curation compared to other networks. It’s hard to find Twitter accounts I may like, since “People to Follow” generally seems pretty random for me (or it’s just simply accounts I’ve recently viewed).</li><li>The blatant stealing of content from accounts such as <a href="https://twitter.com/Dory">Dory</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CommonWhiteGirI">Common White Girl</a>, and more discourages content creators from publishing on the platform.</li><li>Tweets are often shared on other social media platforms (such as Instagram), so many people just follow Instagram aggregator accounts that steal content instead of finding it on Twitter. I wonder if there’s a way for Twitter to prevent this in the future or, on the other hand, embrace the fact that this is occurring and find a way to lead people back to their platform.</li></ul><p>This thread of tweets basically sums up my thoughts on Twitter:</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/actioncookbook/status/684513321920413696">@actioncookbook</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500 < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/actioncookbook/status/684513910729347072">@actioncookbook</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500 < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/actioncookbook/status/684515262712967170">@actioncookbook</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500 < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HwWGaBfcoKYK2sQmn27Nnw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*ojO4xZL3Sw_CcZd9XbzPvg.png" /></figure><h3>Snapchat</h3><p>Snapchat has grown tremendously in the past two years. In my 2015 post I called Snapchat addictive and liberating, mostly for the way its design swept away social pressure. By now, everyone I know has a Snapchat account and almost all of them use it on a regular basis. It has become an essential app not only for posting and sharing photos, but for messages as well. The Chat functionality of Snapchat has improved tremendously and I have at least a couple conversations a day on it. Snapchat definitely helped spur its growth by having a “swipe up to reply” functionality for Stories, which I use daily and which makes it easy to start conversations on the platform.</p><p>What I love so much about Snapchat is that the product embraces being fun. People are their authentic selves when they post on Snapchat, using funny filters, lenses, stickers, or inserting their own Bitmoji into Snaps (which is fantastic by the way—a perfect acquisition for Snapchat to make. Everyone I know uses Bitmoji regularly). I also think Snapchat’s stickers are the best stickers in the game right now, and their search functionality for stickers is always on point.</p><p>When someone finds a new lens and tries it, you can see the <a href="https://backchannel.com/how-snapchats-sponsored-lenses-became-a-money-printing-machine-a1e45b0a82b">network effect throughout your feed</a> and see everyone else giving it a shot as well, even if the lens isn’t the most flattering. Snapchat allows you to have fun and be yourself in a way no other social network can right now, especially with the absence of most of the external social pressure of other networks, where you worry about how many likes you’ve collected.</p><p>Even so, lately I’ve been running into some issues with Snapchat. Because everyone I know uses it, there’s often too much happening, especially with Stories. Snapchat has implemented a few product features to try to combat this, but it still seems pretty tedious to go through my entire feed to find specific friends whose Stories I want to see. Snapchat should take a cue from Instagram (since Instagram took so many cues from Snapchat) and organize their Stories based on engagement/interaction from the user. As of now, my feed honestly kind of stresses me out. I also wish you could hide Stories from friends—for some people who post a lot, I don’t necessarily want to see their Stories, but I still want them to be able to message me (and vice-versa).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Vyb3FyACdbzipaW-msEURA.png" /></figure><h3>The Others</h3><ul><li><strong>LinkedIn — </strong>Ugh.</li><li><strong>Tumblr — </strong>It’s really hard to gauge how relevant Tumblr is since it often isn’t discussed. It seems like to many, the appeal of Tumblr is to have a personal account away from everything else where you can post and share with total strangers (who are generally interested in the same things you are). People don’t often go around advertising their Tumblr accounts or, if they do, they have a public account AND a separate, more personal account for what I just mentioned. I think Tumblr could do a better job of making itself more social and shareable (so people talked about it more), but I also think the closed platform is part of the appeal.</li><li><strong>Kik — </strong>Very popular messaging application with the younger crowd (13–18). Family members who are still in high school tell me they use it all the time. The bots that exist on Kik are well made, and its developer environment and bot store make it one of the most approachable bot applications for developers and users alike.</li><li><strong>WhatsApp — </strong>Although I do not personally use it all that much, WhatsApp is a force to be reckoned with abroad and is definitely not going away anytime soon.</li><li><strong>GroupMe — </strong>Still by far the most used group messaging application in college, although iMessage may eventually take this title away, especially as more people switch to the iPhone. GroupMe has had a few improvements over the years, but I think there’s much more potential for this application than the developers are currently utilizing.</li><li><strong>YouTube — </strong>Really the only place anyone watches videos aside from Facebook. There has been some drama between YouTube and its creators over the past year, and I think YouTube could possibly improve on how it communicates with its creators, given that many have complained about being caught off guard with major changes to the site.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Vyb3FyACdbzipaW-msEURA.png" /></figure><h3><strong>R.I.P.</strong></h3><p>This section is for social networks that have essentially gone away and are completely off the radar for both myself and my peers. This isn’t to say that the networks themselves are bad or anything, just that no one I know ever uses them. Like…ever.</p><ul><li>Vine (<a href="https://backchannel.com/how-vine-overlooked-the-people-of-color-who-made-it-amazing-2d80d4cde651">that one actually went away, though</a>)</li><li>Google+</li><li>Yik Yak</li><li>Plague</li><li>Ello</li><li>Swarm</li></ul><p>I was most surprised to see Vine and Yik Yak fall. As a user of Vine, I could tell the content on the app was becoming stale and people were moving to other platforms. However, I felt a better integration with Twitter could have saved it. Even though the app will become a “<a href="https://medium.com/@vine/vine-update-59426a5adfab#.yvefmg77f">Vine Camera</a>,” Twitter could have done more to engage with influencers on the platform and connect it more to the main Twitter app.</p><p>Yik Yak is different from others on the list because many students in college not only have heard of it, but have even tried it for themselves. However, the lack of continued engagement as well as bullying and harassment sadly proved to be detrimental to the app.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Vyb3FyACdbzipaW-msEURA.png" /></figure><h3>Up And Coming</h3><ul><li><a href="https://musical.ly/">Musical.ly / Live.ly</a> — Musical.ly is a social network where users post lip-syncing videos to everything from music to Vines. Live.ly is a livestreaming application made by Musical.ly. Musical.ly became popular just a few months after my first blog and has taken the social media world by storm. My family members who are still in middle school tell me about how everyone they know is on Musical.ly and how they use Live.ly to keep up with their favorite celebrities, albeit middle school celebrities (what’s up, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxRsDpXPGo">Jacob Sartorius</a>). Musical.ly has a really smooth interface and a thriving community — it’s definitely one to watch.</li><li><a href="https://joinhouse.party/">Houseparty</a> — A video chat application from the minds behind Meerkat. I’ve seen more and more people at my university use Houseparty as a way to hang out and chat with their friends. I have even overheard people talking in class about being on the application, which is generally a really strong sign, especially when the application has done very little traditional campus marketing (which I am a huge fan of staying away from).</li><li><a href="https://curiouscat.me/">Curious Cat</a> — Think of Curious Cat as a more social, next generation version of Ask.fm. It’s a popular Q&amp;A social network, focusing more on personal questions rather than the more general ones that Quora or Yahoo Answers address. Curious Cat has mainly been spreading through Twitter, yet I could see the site becoming more influential if they nail down how to handle harassment on the platform (which is not an easy feat).</li><li><a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> — Discord is a chat application focused on gamers. <a href="https://discordapp.com/features">It has myriad features</a> that help serve its over 300 million users every day. This chat app is highly influential in the gaming sphere and will likely extend beyond that market very soon.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Vyb3FyACdbzipaW-msEURA.png" /></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Social media has changed dramatically over the past two years. A perfect example of this is how Live video emerged at the forefront of companies’ product strategies.</p><p>I don’t think there will ever be “one network to rule them all.” Every network has its own merits. So if I were to offer one piece of advice, let it be this: social networks should stop trying to make one app that does everything. Instead, they should strategically focus on the communities or needs that aren’t already being served by other networks.</p><p><em>Want to get in touch? </em><a href="mailto:andrewwatts@utexas.edu"><em>Shoot me an email</em></a><em> or</em><a href="http://twitter.com/thatswattsup"><em> find me on Twitter</em></a><em>!</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ct_7uWCmmGpkOC4eMNjG_A.png" /></figure><ul><li><a href="https://backchannel.com/a-teenagers-view-on-social-media-1df945c09ac6">A Teenager’s View on Social Media</a></li><li><a href="https://backchannel.com/what-teens-really-think-about-youtube-google-reddit-and-other-social-media-a7263924a506">What Teens Really Think About YouTube, Google+, Reddit and Other Social Media</a></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tnDnWgShPrTmOcRYC2qIgw.png" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3c963703f64" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/where-weird-facebook-is-king-how-a-college-kid-does-social-3c963703f64">Where Weird Facebook is King: How a College Kid Does Social</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel">Backchannel</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OoRrnMDR1v1ALxzsMVqgWg.png" /><figcaption>(Courtesy of GOP Arcade)</figcaption></figure><h4>The GOP Arcade is producing tiny, raw, irreverent games based on the news.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3vIhkoHIzcxvUdijoCVx6w.png" /></figure><p><strong><em>“The world thinks America is weak</em></strong><em>. As Commander-In-Chief, it’s up to you to prove them wrong. By bombing…all of them.”</em></p><p>The words appear on screen, accompanied by a portentous tune reminiscent of late ’90s gaming. A bald eagle looks you straight in the eye.</p><p>“<em>Our sats have detected enemy ground movement just outside of Kabul.”</em></p><p>You have two options for how to handle the situation:</p><ul><li>Look at diplomatic options</li><li>Bomb them</li></ul><p>If you decide to look at diplomatic options, you’ve proven America’s weakness and the game is over. If you decide to bomb them, you will be shown a map of a section of the world, and you’ll need to guess where Kabul is.</p><p>This is “<a href="http://www.thegoparcade.com/game/bomb-the-right-place">Bomb the Right Place</a>,” a game focused on demonstrating America’s force as a nation through bombing, even if we don’t know exactly where to bomb. “Bomb the Right Place” is one of many politically charged games found in the <a href="http://www.thegoparcade.com/">GOP Arcade</a><em>.</em> The site describes itself in an understated fashion as “an ongoing series of lightweight games designed to make all the hoopla surrounding the election slightly more enjoyable.”</p><p>If “Bomb the Right Place” doesn’t lift your spirits, GOP Arcade<em> </em>also offers such diversions as “<a href="http://pussygrabber.com">Trump’s Pussy Grabber</a>,” “<a href="http://www.thegoparcade.com/game/thoughts-and-prayers-the-game">Thoughts and Prayers</a>,” and “<a href="http://www.thegoparcade.com/game/get-trumps-taxes">Get Trump’s Taxes</a>.” The games turn complex subjects (such as the increase in mass shootings across the United States) into simple, two-button activities delivered in an 8-bit aesthetic. The result is a dissonant mashup of challenging concepts with a raw production value that feels nothing like a newspaper article or TV news segment.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/667/1*4-uOYpcq94GfMrInf7iGNQ.png" /><figcaption>(Courtesy of GOP Arcade)</figcaption></figure><p>Now you may be asking: “So what? Why should I care about a dumb 8-bit game about the election?” The answer is simple: these dumb, 8-bit games might be the first, primordial examples of a new form of communication.</p><p>GOP Arcade has tapped into the trend among younger people of consuming information in a quick, flashy, often piecemeal way. The first company to fully capitalize on this emerging behavior was BuzzFeed, which identified how millennials consumed information and tailored their content to match this pattern. But with the presidential election dominating an entire year of news, GOP Arcade<em> </em>is one of a slew of sites that has seized on creative, nontraditional ways to comment on and engage with the news. It’s a hint of where media might be headed next, in the great battle over The Attention of Millennials (And Those Even Younger).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d97UzsZ2OyFVRGj2cQKyeQ.png" /></figure><p><strong>Chris Baker, co-founder of GOP Arcade</strong>, says the idea for the site came to him and his creative partner Mike Lacher when they were working as creative directors at BuzzFeed. The duo began playing around with the idea of producing news in an interactive, playable format. This had been done before, but they were looking for something more creative than the quiz-based games that other news outlets were producing. They left BuzzFeed in late 2013, but kept kicking around the idea.</p><p>“So the idea is playable news,” Baker says. But they needed a focus. “Given how much news is out there, we wanted to dial it in and make it specifically about the election.”</p><p>The election was useful in that it had predictable events that Baker and Lacher could plan around. And it was guaranteed to hold the country’s attention for most of the year. So in February of 2016, Baker, Lacher, and a third collaborator, Brian Moore, started dreaming up the GOP Arcade. “Since we’re bleeding-heart liberals from Brooklyn, we wanted to make it completely one-sided and give it a name people will remember,” Baker says.</p><p>As their thinking crystallized, they realized that games took too long to develop for them to hinge on short-lived headlines. “We knew it would take a while to get together,” Baker explains, “so we wanted to focus on larger issues rather than news-specific events from the beginning.” When the site launched in April 2016, its first three games were not pegged to specific events. They were:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.thegoparcade.com/game/good-guy-with-a-gun">“Good Guy With A Gun</a>,” a twisted version of Diner Dash where you’re delivering customers guns, not food.</li><li><a href="http://www.thegoparcade.com/game/bomb-the-right-place">“Bomb the Right Place</a>,” the aforementioned “where is Kabul” geography test.</li><li><a href="http://www.thegoparcade.com/game/trump-toss">“Trump Toss</a>,”an exercise in deporting immigrants by flinging them over a wall that grows taller with time.</li></ul><p>Most of the GOP Arcade games since then have similarly tended to focus on events that “won’t be over in three days,” says Baker. Yet the creators still wanted to be able to react to the news—so they opted for an 8-bit cartoonish style for their games. “8-bit was the fastest way to do it since it gives you so much leeway in terms of character design,” Baker explains. “You don&#39;t have to be perfect, it’s fast to create, it can scale really easily between platforms/devices, and it makes you nostalgic. Many of our game mechanics derived from 8-bit games, so it only made sense that our design would match.”</p><p>The fairly simple mechanics of their games mean they can be developed in anywhere from a few hours to two weeks. So far, the games developed in “just a few hours” have been by far the most popular. “Thoughts and Prayers” was released four days after the Orlando shooting earlier this year, yet it garnered more press and traffic than any other GOP Arcade<em> </em>game, with about 30 press articles, including ones in the <em>Boston Globe</em>, Slate, and Fusion. After news of the shooting broke on Sunday, Baker and his team met up on Tuesday to discuss the project. By Thursday, they had launched.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/605/1*_HiOG0T3vpBDejs_UlLAJA.png" /><figcaption>(Courtesy of GOP Arcade)</figcaption></figure><p>In “Thoughts and Prayers,” you watch as alerts of new mass killings pop up on a map of the US, and you have to choose between “thinking” and “praying” in response. At the end, it tallies your thoughts and prayers, and also the lives you saved: zero. It’s visceral, and not something you can describe in a sentence — so people want to share it, to allow others to see for themselves. To date, over 30 million thoughts and prayers have been sent by 600,000 players.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_dJHHAJFu3i68xcQskPWyg.png" /></figure><p><strong>Baker doesn’t even consider “</strong>Thoughts and Prayers” a game, but rather a “fast mechanism to convey a point.” A similar mechanism can be seen in “<a href="http://www.thegoparcade.com/game/get-trumps-taxes">Get Trump’s Taxes</a>,”<em> </em>where the player must try to rip Donald Trump’s taxes from his hands as quickly as possible. These aren’t games in the traditional sense, but podiums from which Baker and his team can be heard.</p><p>“Our ultimate goal with the GOP Arcade<em> </em>was to create a gaming platform that simultaneously existed as op-ed commentary and as an education to people about the important issues in the election,” says Baker.</p><p>It’s not the only new take on the election tailored to a millennial mindset. <a href="http://www.superdeluxe.com/">Super Deluxe</a>, for example, is a production company that has been producing videos this election on everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoXDe8HxHBA">Hillary Clinton’s millennial pandering</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96esIUaFqmU">Melania Trump’s Response to the Trump Tapes</a>. These videos are a breath of fresh air and a welcome antidote to the undifferentiated content dished out by too many major media companies. They’re a form of political commentary tailored to our youth culture in a way that only the youths may truly understand.</p><p>Both Super Deluxe and GOP Arcade take topics that are potentially “boring,” such as the debates or an issue like immigration, and spice them up with bright, flashy graphics and simple messaging. Another example, from slightly farther afield, is the site <a href="https://www.voteplz.org/">voteplz.org</a>. It does a similar thing in taking a boring action from the election —voter registration — and adding some flash in the form of emojis and, again, simple messaging.</p><p>All three of these examples assume that their users share some background context. And that, too, helps drive users to share the games on their social feeds. “Trump’s Pussy Grabber,” a riff on whack-a-mole involving cats, wouldn’t make much sense without the background context of the event it’s referencing. Because viewers feel “in on the joke,” they feel more motivated to share the content to showcase to their friends or followers how hip they are. And because it’s not just another link to yet another article or video, GOP Arcade stands out from the normal posts that an average social networker would find in their feeds.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aEWM90Fs7_dqFik2TJNElw.png" /><figcaption>(Courtesy of GOP Arcade)</figcaption></figure><p>GOP Arcade plans on creating one final game, about voter suppression, before wrapping up its election coverage. Then Baker and his team intend to apply their learnings from GOP Arcade to <a href="http://everydayarcade.com">Everyday Arcade</a><em>,</em> a new site that Baker hopes will become “the gaming version of <em>The Onion</em> or <em>The Daily Show.</em>”</p><p>Whether or not the format thrives outside the highly charged environment of a presidential election, Baker’s team has hit on a powerful idea. The concept of irreverent, newsy, bite-sized games weaves together many of the trends in media consumption among younger demographics. So if GOP Arcade is any indication, soon you won’t just be reading or watching the news. You’ll also be playing it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jLEVLzRMAc8XqIXbRfcIUg.png" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=46a439c5fdef" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/the-news-is-now-literally-a-video-game-46a439c5fdef">The News Is Now Literally a Video Game</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel">Backchannel</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> ]]>

It’s cold. I’m sitting on a chairlift with my high school friend Jon Berkowitz heading to the summit of some East Coast mountain. We both have Sony MiniDisc players (an extremely short-lived era), and Jon wants to share a song. He’s picking at the headphone cables, trying to untangle the mess and keep his MiniDisc from dropping below. By the time we reach the summit, his headphones have knotted into a ball of frozen wires.</p><p>We can all relate. The hassle. The annoyance. Our headphones tangled with lint from our linty pockets.</p><p>Yet as a product, the headphone could be the sleeper technology of the future.</p><p>I came to this realization 17 years after my chairlift conversation. When <a href="https://twitter.com/lifeofc">Chikai Ohazama</a>, formerly an EIR at Google Ventures and co-founder of Keyhole, told me about a $13 bluetooth earbud he tested (and actually liked), I went to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Bluetooth-Headphone-Hands-free-Smartphone/dp/B00Z0ME68A">Amazon</a> and placed an order immediately. I’d been familiar with over-the-ear bluetooth earphones, but this was different. It was the first time I owned a small, wireless device that was similar to something I imagined as a kid. More exciting, was the possibility that this piece of technology — if widely adopted — had the ability to power a voice platform. Plus, did I mention it was only $13?!</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/lifeofc/status/708078207723909121">@lifeofc</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500 < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><p>I put the earbud through its paces and was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>The $13 EGRD was cheap and cheerful. I could multi-task with a stream of information feeding me while walking, working, or making dinner. I could leave my phone in my pocket or at my desk without having to constantly check it for notifications. I could send messages (though not as efficiently as texting) by speaking to Siri. I really enjoyed it as a piece of hardware.</p><p>I spent 14 days with the $13 EGRD bluetooth earbud. I incorporated it into my daily life as much as possible. In the mornings: listening to NPR, cycling to music, driving to meetings using Google Map directions, and “reading” articles using <a href="https://500ish.com/listen-2167a6bbd81e#.ydiaz7p5s">a hack shared by M.G. Siegler.</a> At night: commuting home from work, talking to family, cooking to a podcast, falling asleep to music as my girlfriend lay in bed with no idea that I had a computer in my ear.</p><p>Yes, the device has its obvious shortcomings. The discomfort, the high-frequency buzzing when the device was muted, the poor battery life, the poor Bluetooth connectivity, the awkward click-button that was uncomfortable to use, and, more interesting to me, the awkward social implications where people thought I was paying attention but in reality, I was engaged with the latest Serial podcast. Even with its downsides, I began to love this little device for what it could be.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-7Bu0tgdj5W8yf9EHxhLKA.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wKsDyUxjbGZ-WoKShCmyzQ.png" /><figcaption><em>Wireless headset invention by </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Ullman"><em>Johan Ullman</em></a><em>, 1989</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>In that seventeen year gap </strong>between the chairlift and my EGRD experiment, the technology and design of buds had not dramatically changed. In 2001, the iPod was released with its iconic white earbuds. In 2007, Apple debuted the iPhone and included a remote and microphone. Bluetooth headsets were in vogue with cab drivers and fathers wearing silly belt clips. Stereo bluetooth headphones made an appearance on TV from athletes sponsored by Beats. But none of these iterations transformed how we computed. During most of the mobile computing era we remained tethered to our headphones.</p><p>But while the hardware failed to evolve beyond the cable, a war for our voice was quietly being waged by Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.</p><p>When Apple released the iPhone 4s equipped with Siri in 2011, we had a glimpse into the magic that could set our hands free. At that time, it seemed that voice computing would be the new battleground. It could schedule our meetings, remind us to pick up the kids, order tonight’s dinner, fetch information, make purchases, entertain us with jokes, etc. There seemed something magical about Siri when it debuted.</p><p>But something went awry. Siri got us all wrong. Google Now wanted us to speak in keywords. In the living room, XBOX failed to do basic commands like, “XBOX, turn on.” Amazon debuted Fire TV and voice search, which flamed out, only to be upstaged by Amazon Echo and Alexa. (We learned recently that Amazon’s amazing Echo <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-amazon-echo/">originally shipped with a remote</a>, but customers didn’t use it. Its ubiquity was limited by its proximity.) The prospect of a truly persistent voice input system, for the most part of this century, was not clicking with customers — especially mobile customers.</p><p>Maybe as a result of this failing, as we spent more and more time with our phones, our communication habits conversely shifted from a voice-based input system to a text-based system. Text as an communication input is <a href="http://whoo.ps/2015/02/23/futures-of-text">where we are today</a> and where many entrepreneurs (myself included) are investing as the future.</p><p>Each new platform begets a new platform. Platform evolution is rooted in how we communicate and with whom we communicate. The general consensus by technologists is that the next platform shift will emerge from chat applications like <a href="https://medium.com/greylock-perspectives/building-to-independence-on-top-of-other-platforms-5e6f2f8b0249#.nc2k6ecwt">WeChat, SnapChat, Messenger, WhatsApp, Kik, Slack, and Telegram</a>, which have been engaged in a war over this medium, luring developers to build bot services. Text-based startups like Magic, Operator, and Fin aim to enable services on top of these platforms, offering fast and easy transactions. But then what? What’s after our current platform shift into text?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-7Bu0tgdj5W8yf9EHxhLKA.png" /></figure><p><strong>For my EGRD experiment,</strong> I wanted to understand the longevity of “chat as a platform,” which many technologists and companies have said to be the next paradigm. I was curious to know if we’re about to leapfrog the chat platform to something else, like a voice platform powered by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. If so, what might this look like? Could the next social network be created on an audio interface, like <a href="https://medium.com/@anchorfm/introducing-anchor-the-first-true-public-radio-9d4c98c0a495#.ogg1a4sxu">Anchor</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/roger-talk/we-should-talk-more-often-75360cfddc73#.jo7mfx2jf">Rodger</a>?</p><p>This $13 earbud allowed me a glimpse into a future where audio and voice become the user interface.</p><p>An in-ear smart device can be more intimate than a phone or smartwatch. The device lends itself to a new relationship — not too different than the operating system Samantha in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/">“Her”</a> — to information and the people or bots delivering the information. Over time, I found myself to be more “in my head” while wearing the device, thinking or having discussions with myself (or a bot) even when nothing was playing. At times this new intimacy was isolating, both from my surroundings and my activities. I eventually removed the device while cycling, grocery shopping, or meeting people because I simply could not focus on what was in front of me without being aware of the device.</p><p>As a medium, audio is truly more captivating and more difficult to ignore than text. It’s what makes the recall of advertisements in podcasts 3x greater than online video ads. I can understand how this engagement and intimacy could be overwhelming. But there is wonderful attribute about the device — if I wanted to unplug, I could simply remove the earbud and slip it into my pocket. That’s something we can’t do with our watches or phones because they will still buzz and beep at us.</p><p>We’re a quarter way through 2016, and entrepreneurs like Sam Lessin have <a href="https://www.fin.ventures/letters/on-bots-conversational-apps-and-fin">called it “the year of the bots” </a>— a statement confirmed by Facebook’s F8 announcement that it was <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/04/messenger-platform-at-f8/">opening Messenger to business bots</a>. Indeed, I am beginning to see that we have the convergence of bots, AI, home technology, self-driving cars, and rumors of an iPhone 7 that omits the 3.5mm headphone jack. What is missing is a device that can harmonize these technologies.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-7Bu0tgdj5W8yf9EHxhLKA.png" /></figure><p><strong>As Chikai and I mused about our $13 experiments,</strong> we settled on the hypothesis that only the major hardware and software companies, like Apple and Google, can fully integrate an in-ear technology with our phones, homes, and cars. The user experience is otherwise too fragmented or niche (e.g. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/video/doppler-labs-here-active-listening-system/519617918">Doppler’s Here device</a>).</p><p>I even have a wish list: iPhone 7 with Bluetooth EarPods; Siri becomes an open platform for developers (like Amazon’s Alexa); iMessage becomes an open platform for developers (like Slack, Messenger, Telegram).</p><p>By putting these devices in our ears, they become part of our bodies, a sort of permanent prosthetics that boost us bionically. Wearable computers can accelerate our biological evolution.</p><p>Yet, I start to wonder as technology becomes more personalized and intimately a part of our bodies, how far do we push technological boundaries? As a teacher commented when learning about in-ear technology, “At what point must I check the ears of my students before they enter my classroom for an exam?” The question to us, as technologists and consumers of technology, at what point does a device that is constantly on you — listening to you, watching you, and learning everything about you — cross lines of personal privacy, or challenge our concepts of natural selection, or perhaps fundamentally puts into question what is mean to be human?</p><p>What I’m trying to get at is that I think an in-ear technology will deeply influence how we — for better or worse — have relationships with people, bots, businesses, and ourselves. I am convinced that it will be a major platform.</p><p>But in the meantime, a $13 device can provide us salient insights about how we might connect with information and people. I hope someone gets this right soon.</p><p>The future is more [n]ear than we think.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GWTqG-xCVOp4BKQw0ZU14A.jpeg" /><figcaption>In-ear device from the movie, “Her” (2013).</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*goZbu6xHQBZGlrxzqyfAig.png" /></figure><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jondotli"><em>Jon Li</em></a><em> is a serial entrepreneur who co-founded Snack and was product director at Vevo.</em></p><p><strong>Here are some resources for background and further thinking.</strong></p><ul><li>Chikai Ohazama’s “<a href="https://twitter.com/lifeofc/status/708078207723909121">Earbud post</a>”</li><li>MG Siegler’s “<a href="https://500ish.com/listen-2167a6bbd81e#.voo81q9nv">Listen</a>”</li><li>$13 EGRD<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Bluetooth-Headphone-Hands-free-Smartphone/dp/B00Z0ME68A"> Bluetooth Earbud</a></li><li>Design.Co’s “<a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3057483/the-next-big-tech-revolution-will-be-in-your-ear">The Next Big Revolution</a>”</li><li>Johan Ullman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Ullman">“bluetooth” headset</a>:</li><li>Jonathan Libov’s “<a href="http://whoo.ps/2015/02/23/futures-of-text">Future of Text</a>”</li><li>Josh Elman’s “<a href="https://medium.com/greylock-perspectives/building-to-independence-on-top-of-other-platforms-5e6f2f8b0249#.nc2k6ecwt">Building Independence on top of other Platforms</a>”</li><li>Sam Lessin’s “<a href="https://www.fin.ventures/letters/on-bots-conversational-apps-and-fin">On Bots, Conversation Apps, and Fin</a>”</li><li>TechCrunch’s “<a href="http://techcrunch.com/video/doppler-labs-here-active-listening-system/519617918">Doppler Here Review</a>”</li><li>The Economists “<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696477-market-apps-maturing-now-one-text-based-services-or-chatbots-looks-poised">Bots, The Next Frontier</a>”</li></ul><p><em>You can also</em>👂<em> </em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/jondotli/what-if-the-future-of-technology-was-in-your-ear-1"><em>this article</em></a><em>. </em>😀</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fw.soundcloud.com%2Fplayer%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fapi.soundcloud.com%252Ftracks%252F260092809%26show_artwork%3Dtrue&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fjondotli%2Fwhat-if-the-future-of-technology-was-in-your-ear-1&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-000159136248-jza9a9-t500x500.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=soundcloud" width="500" height="166" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/857192e362b06dd0ee6780c37750f8d0/href">https://medium.com/media/857192e362b06dd0ee6780c37750f8d0/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Many thanks to </strong><a href="http://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu/about-us/people/brandon-schechter"><strong>Dr. Brandon Schechter</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/beatnomad"><strong>Jessie Beck</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenkg"><strong>Katherine Chen</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href="https://medium.com/@lifeofc"><strong>Chikai Ohazama</strong></a><strong> for reviewing drafts of this essay.</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8c276b810413" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/the-future-of-technology-is-in-your-ear-8c276b810413">The Future of Technology Is In Your Ear</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel">Backchannel</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>What’s Your Hour in ‘Silicon Valley Time’?</h2><h4><strong>The tech press moves like clockwork, fitting company narratives into a predictable arc. Here’s how pros deal with it.</strong></h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*R5as0pB4bnLJJEY8YzR8Lw.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>I don’t remember</strong> who told me company narratives were like a clock. I was at Google, where I’d taken a job on the communications team despite zero experience in communications. During my early days there, I tried to navigate my new profession by listening to the many comms experts already at the company from whom I would learn so much. One theory about narratives stuck with me:</p><p><em>A company’s narrative moves like a clock: it starts at midnight, ticking off the hours. The tone and sentiment about how a business is doing move from positive (sunrise, midday) to negative (dusk, darkness). And often the story returns to midnight, rebirth and a new day.</em></p><p>It was a passing remark, and hardly revolutionary — it closely followed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth">hero’s journey</a> and other theories of storytelling. But it made a ton of sense.</p><p>Over the years, I developed the idea by filling in the times on the clock. It has helped to be in tech; startups in particular, always begin with a “founding story,” and follow a typical path through Silicon Valley Time (SVT). It’s not perfect, of course. Companies can skip an hour — or in some cases <a href="http://recode.net/2014/03/13/clinkles-still-a-hot-mess-as-its-big-shot-coo-departs/">several</a>. Others get stuck along the way, and with a stalled narrative (and broken clock) <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/18/7413417/secret-is-re-launching-as-a-faster-anonymous-social-network-with-chat">cease to be relevant</a>.</p><p>Knowing the general time of a company has made it easier for me to see around corners and better do my job.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RRj2nvLLI8kgtqGXFgrcTg.png" /></figure><h2>Part One: The Clock</h2><h4><strong>12:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Birth. (No one cares.)</strong></h3><p>If you’re already making news at 12:00, you’ve probably been <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/biz-stone-evan-williams-and-jason-goldman-launch-medium-2012-8">successful before</a>, since the mere founding of your company is of little interest. If you’re in the press this early for any <em>other</em> reason, odds are it isn’t good.</p><p>Once in a blue moon, if you’re really bad, you can circle the entire clock in one move. This usually requires a launch that alienates everyone with a mix of presumption and “star power,” exacerbated by the amount of money raised or an over-reliance on PR.</p><p>My favorite example of this is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/24/color/">Color</a>, a photo app that raised $41 million in March 2011 and went from darling to devil in 24 hours. It never recovered. (Tidal Music: you’re <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/06/23/jay-zs-tidal-loses-second-ceo-after-just-three-months/">on your way</a>.)</p><h4><strong>1:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Shiny new toy.</strong></h3><p>It’s around 1:00 that the first real article is written about your company. With the right connections, anyone can make it to 1:00. You’ve launched your product, raised money from a few prominent investors, and your app makes for a good headline. People don’t feel strongly about you, one way or the other, but now they have heard of you, and that matters.</p><p>Today, many 1:00 companies are the “Uber for” something, like <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/522845588212051969">house painting</a>.</p><p><a href="https://reserve.com/">Reserve</a>, the Uber for restaurants, currently <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/02/11/reserve-funding/">sits at 1:00</a>.</p><h4><strong>2:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Up-and-comer.</strong></h3><p>Rounding 2:00 is a real accomplishment — many startups never make it this far. At 2:00, you are seeing real traction. You haven’t quite reached escape velocity, but the momentum is exciting, which you can see on Twitter and in the increasing amount of tech coverage you’re getting. Smart takes in Buzzfeed, Re/Code, and The Verge are accompanied by vanity metrics. Bigger companies start to wonder (a) why their version of your thing isn’t as popular as your thing, and (b) whether and how fast they can copy your thing and make it their thing.</p><p>With its breakout at SXSW early this year, Meerkat <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw">reached 2:00</a>. Hence, <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/26/twitter-periscope-hands-on/">Periscope</a>.</p><h4><strong>3:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Industry disrupter.</strong></h3><p>Not every company spends time at 3:00. Some burn out after takeoff. Others skip to a later hour. But things get interesting at 3:00. Most importantly, mainstream business press (New York Times, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal) start to pay attention. They give your story credibility by attempting to paint the bigger picture.</p><p>Examples of once-3:00 companies include Airbnb, Square, and Uber. In each case, the early product was interesting — rent out your spare bedroom (or crash on someone’s couch); accept a credit card on your phone; hail a black car on demand. But as they grew, these companies’ greater potential — if nothing else, for “disruption” — became clear. For Airbnb, that meant upending the hospitality industry; for Square, increasing access to financial services; for Uber, cruising past the taxi market and changing the nature of transportation. 3:00 companies are a diverse bunch.</p><p>Zenefits, which Forbes writes is “disrupting a stodgy industry most people know nothing about: small business human resources,” is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2014/12/17/how-zenefits-beat-out-uber-airbnb-to-become-2014s-hottest-startup/">looking good at 3:00</a>.</p><h4><strong>4:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Hottest company in the Valley.</strong></h3><p>At 4:00, business (and media) momentum drives your recruiting. Everyone wants to work for the next big thing, which makes your company the hottest in the Valley. Your press@ alias is blowing up and you’re drowning in opportunities. So you do everything: that means <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/the-most-fascinating-profile-youll-ever-read-about-a-guy-and-his-boring-startup/">founder profiles</a>, <a href="http://qz.com/249222/slacks-explosive-word-of-mouth-growth-in-one-amazing-chart/">hockey stick graphs</a> — you even start to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/22/slack-wsj-charleston-_n_7636284.html">make news</a> when you’re not trying to. If you’re a consumer product, you’re probably landing on the big morning shows.</p><p>Today, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-23/slack-is-said-to-be-in-funding-talks-at-2-billion-plus-value">it’s 4:00</a> at Slack. Everyone loves Slack.</p><h4><strong>5:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Rapid expansion and growth.</strong></h3><p>At 5:00, everything is gravy. You’re growing fast and your valuation is skyrocketing. Reports that you’re losing money? If you’re at 5:00, those reports are irrelevant. Your strategy is smart, your projections are sound, and your successful execution is inevitable. You’re a winner.</p><p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/10/15/inside-pinterest-the-coming-ad-colossus-that-could-dwarf-twitter-and-facebook/">Pinterest</a> and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secret-math-of-airbnbs-24-billion-valuation-1434568517">Airbnb</a> are cruising at 5:00.</p><h4><strong>6:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Greatest company in the world!</strong></h3><p>In a company’s journey, growth and success are followed by struggles and doubt. Which is why, at the top of the mountain, there is no where to go but down.</p><h4><strong>6:01 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Greatest company in the world?</strong></h3><p>It starts at 6:01. From there, it’s a choose-your-own-adventure of negative storylines. “Failure to innovate.” “Monetization problems.” “Employee exodus.” The dreaded “privacy issues.” Each company’s turn around the clock is unique, but there are some common themes.</p><h4><strong>7:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>Their product kind of sucks.</strong></h3><p>Dropbox’s alleged product development “s — show” and “slowing innovation” <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-clock-is-ticking-for-dropbox-2015-4">landed it at 7:00</a> about a month ago. (Which means 8:00 is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/dropbox-is-struggling-and-competitors-are-catching-up">on its way</a>.)</p><p>Twitter — having rounded the clock several times — is dealing with a special <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/06/03/chris-sacca-on-what-twitter-can-be/">“What is the future of [company]?”</a> dimension of 7:00.</p><h4><strong>8:00 SVT:</strong></h4><h3><strong>They’re never going to make any money.</strong></h3><p>I spent several years at Google trying to move YouTube <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121557163349038289">past 8:00</a>.

A negative story has nothing to do with you. It also doesn’t help. When you’re angry, you look defensive. You overreact and make mistakes. Don’t yell at reporters for doing their job — it gets you nowhere. Just take the punch and move on.</p><h4><strong>2.</strong></h4><h3><strong>Don’t force anything.</strong></h3><p>In a crisis (after 6:00), you feel like you have to <em>do</em> something. At the very least, your executive team may be agitating for it. But it’s easy to forget: doing nothing <em>is</em> doing something. Stand your ground and be disciplined about press opportunities. Don’t attempt to land the “turnaround” story too quickly. It’s dangerous — narratives are sticky and create a frame through which all news is processed. If your frame is negative, everything is an uphill battle. Avoid unforced errors.</p><h4><strong>3.</strong></h4><h3><strong>Be humble.</strong></h3><p>Your company isn’t perfect. You’ve made mistakes. It’s OK to own up to them. Humility shrinks the target on your back. What would you have done differently? What have you learned? How will you apply those lessons moving forward? Being reasonable also gives you credibility. You’ll have more battles to fight in the future — don’t waste your credibility fighting something that’s already been litigated. Save it: it’s a precious resource.</p><h4><strong>4.</strong></h4><h3><strong>Focus on your customers and your team.</strong></h3><p>If you read the news in 2010, <a href="http://fortune.com/2010/07/29/google-the-search-party-is-over/">Google was over</a>: Android phones couldn’t compare to the iPhone. Chrome market share was in the single digits. Facebook was launching a Gmail killer. We know how <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/24/ios-android-market-share-q4-2014/">those</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">stories</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+launches+gmail+killer&amp;oq=facebook+launches+gmail+killer&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2789j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=facebook+gmail+killer">ended</a>. Instead of worrying about the press, Google focused on its users, made <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/28/business/la-fi-google-crazy-ventures-20101029">even more big bets</a>, and built great products. They continued to make Google an amazing place to work that kept employees happy, passionate, and motivated.</p><p>We’ve tried to bring that same discipline of focusing on customers to Square, and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-square-payroll-20150629-story.html">it’s paid off</a>. It’s helped that <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">my boss</a> believes this intently, having plenty of experience himself with the ups and downs of the press.</p><p>So just ignore the chatter and ship. If your business is a good one and you know how to manage the clock, your story will take care of itself.</p><p>In time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QXPFTt0jOZKk4eEiVci9cA.png" /></figure><p>Follow Backchannel: <a href="https://twitter.com/backchnnl"><em>Twitter</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671"><em>Facebook</em></a></p><p><em>Aaron Zamost is currently head of communications at Square.

La ]]>
<![CDATA[ tely it has been enjoying a rather outlandish level of exposure. Much of the credit goes to journalists <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-autonomous-cars/280360/">applying the problem to autonomous cars.</a> Those discussions end up feeling remote and theoretical. Yet by revising the problem just slightly, it can contribute to both a realistic and urgent debate on self-driving cars… which is precisely what I’m fixin’ to do in this article.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/863/1*5owqaFZUZuds3NwHTb1ABA.png" /><figcaption>Google Trend for “trolley problem”. Apparently the holiday season makes people really, really philosophical.</figcaption></figure><p>First, let’s make sure everyone is on the same page. What follows is one iteration of the original trolley problem:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*icPwFTzq7y8fFw2VgsTCUg.png" /></figure><p><strong>Version 1:</strong> There is a runaway trolley barreling towards a group of five people standing on the track, none of whom are cognizant of the train’s approach. They will surely be killed unless the trolley is diverted to its alternate track, on which only one person is standing. You are situated at the track switch, and are the only one able to divert the trolley so that it kills one person rather than five. Would you throw the switch?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*0y2T367V6fc8i0iTKKlOjw.png" /></figure><p><strong>Version 2, “The Fat Man”:</strong> Because most of us would claim that throwing the switch is the obvious answer, an alternate version of the problem was created to instill a more realistic sense of responsibility and challenge the otherwise utilitarian response. In this alternative, there is no second track, nor any switch you can throw to save the five people. The only thing you can do to stop the trolley is to shove an extremely fat man standing beside you onto the track, which will bring the trolley safely to a halt—but obviously kill the fat man in turn. Now, the question becomes less black and white: is it best to intentionally cause harm to one person for the greater good? Or is it best to not use your judgment of a situation as the decider of anyone’s fate?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*k_CiMiXdPqY8Mc46LOQI_g.jpeg" /></figure><p>Ok, so wait: I must push beloved Family Feud host Louie Anderson into a train, in order to save five assumed non-Family Feud hosts? I can’t get behind that.</p><p>I suggest a new version of this debate; one that I think is utterly necessary as we prepare to hand responsibility to the robots.</p><p><strong>Consider “The Infinite Trolley.”</strong> You are now the conductor of the trolley, steaming down that single track towards a solitary victim-to-be stuck in your path. You can simply hit the brakes to reach a stop and save this person.</p><p>There is, of course, a caveat.</p><p>Your trolley is infinitely long. It’s filled with as many passengers as it takes to make you reconsider stopping the train. Thousands? Millions? Billions? All those people, each of them with their own needs, expectations and responsibilities, all of which will be thrown off by varying degrees should you decide to stop their trip. Now then, what’s your price? How long does your trolley need to be for the convenience of many to outweigh the life of one?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*IYSe1YKmwu-e75-8wO05tQ.png" /></figure><p>So far, I’ve posed this dilemma to four very intelligent people. While their reactions and conclusions varied, not one of them was willing to consider that this could be a real-world problem.</p><p>It is.</p><p>Americans take roughly <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/2013cpr/chap1.htm">250 billion trips</a> with their cars annually. In the process, we kill over <a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx">30,000 people</a> through traffic accidents—which means that one car-related death is deemed an acceptable price to pay for you to have the convenience of taking 8 million trips. Or, for the sake of this article, for 8 million of us to take one trip in a very large vehicle.</p><p>So, with just a dash of fuzzy math, the Infinite Trolley problem is solved: you would choose to run down the victim if your trolley had more than 8,000,000 passengers on board. And when I say <em>“you would,”</em> I mean <em>“you do.”</em> Now, don’t tell me you’re refusing to take responsibility on the grounds that running someone over involves intent, and is an entirely different act from merely being aware that someone will have been run over for your benefit. To that, I can only respond with the wisdom of South Park: it sure is nice to have your cake and eat it too.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fembed.html%3Feid%3D6LDRal6vYTrGoFGUMh3cDA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fwatch%2F261615&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fib.huluim.com%2Fvideo%2F40005792%3Fsize%3D512x288%26caller%3Dh1o%26img%3Di&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=hulu" width="512" height="296" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/009ae62408a3f4ee74d4eac7259147e4/href">https://medium.com/media/009ae62408a3f4ee74d4eac7259147e4/href</a></iframe><p>Those who have read my earlier piece, <a href="https://medium.com/@mitchturck/i-find-your-lack-of-faith-in-autonomous-cars-disturbing-c5f249e9e623"><em>I Find Your Lack Of Faith In Autonomous Cars Disturbing</em></a><em>,</em> probably know where I’m going with all this, but humor me: if you’re among the many who opted to throw the switch or stop the train, why are you not aggressively supporting autonomous fleets?</p><p>Virtually all <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/self-driving-cars-could-cut-down-on-accidents-study-says-1425567905">evidence</a> and logic states that we would kill far fewer people with an autonomous vehicle grid—even now, with the technology still in its infancy. A bit of reading on the topic, however, reveals that many vested parties, from politicians to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/24/volvo-test-autonomous-cars-ordinary-drivers-public-roads-by-2017">car manufacturers</a> to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/cars/article/2013-09/google-self-driving-car">Google-related sources</a>, have all made some implication of the following statement:</p><blockquote>Autonomous car technology needs to be perfected before we can bring it to the market. 99% isn’t good enough.</blockquote><p>This statement is—in addition to being mathematically misleading to most of the population—effectively a manifestation of the decision not to throw the switch for entirely selfish reasons. By refusing to release a safer technology to the public until it is “perfect,” these parties are telling us that they don’t want to be responsible for having made the decision to kill one person, because the decision to let five die is an outcome society has already learned to accept without judgment. That could be rational if the follow-up to such a statement was, “so let’s pour significant funding into autonomous tech, and fast-track established developments to market.” But for the life of me, I can’t seem to find that <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2014/USDOT+to+Move+Forward+with+Vehicle-to-Vehicle+Communication+Technology+for+Light+Vehicles">blip</a> on the radar of our nation’s <a href="http://www.dot.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/2014-2018-strategic-plan_0.pdf">transportation strategy</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/840/1*rOEJpF-XWl_RTeMfOc5c4g.jpeg" /></figure><p>I suppose I can understand this position coming from a Google or Uber, because they’ve never before been involved in any conversation about the costs and plight of lost life due to automotive travel; by sticking their nose in the situation they run the risk of being seen as causing new deaths rather than preventing all those “regular” deaths we don’t seem to mind. But to the entities who do answer for the 30,000+ annual deaths—the NHTSA, DOT, car manufacturers, the dissenting public—shame on you. You’re making the case to kill thousands of people every year, and getting off scot-free thanks to mere misinformation. There will very soon come a point where autonomous technology proves itself to be consistently safer on certain roads or in certain cities, and it would be a tragedy for the powers that be to neglect or hinder such a development simply because it requires owning up to a decision and jarring people loose from the routine which keeps them predictably tranquilized and non-participating.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ohyycinH18fz98TCyUzVgQ.png" /></figure><p>Good grief. Let me regain my composure, because I haven’t gotten to the point of why the Infinite Trolley problem needs to be addressed.</p><p>What the Infinite Trolley does—as illustrated by our little math exercise above—is stage a scenario that forces you to realize there is currency serving as the building blocks for the things we value. Loosely put, our example depicted one human life as being worth 8 million units of currency, but its origin goes deeper than the mere convenience of transportation. And, even if you disagree entirely with the math and believe one human life is priceless, then the logic would follow that two human lives are doubly as priceless, and so you too make choices based on currency.</p><p>Why is this important? Because as autonomous vehicles have progressed, we’ve come to realize that we can engineer them to solve problems like the trolley dilemma, thanks to the speed and volume with which they can process and act on data. Moreover, the nature of the statement “we need self-driving cars to be perfect” is not only that we <em>can</em> engineer these cars to solve such problems, but that we <em>must</em>.</p><p>Trouble is, in order for self-driving cars to solve the problems, they need to have a grasp of said “currency” in order to work out the decisioning logic as situations present themselves. In short: they need a level of awareness we don’t have about ourselves.</p><p>Journalists citing the trolley problem have posed questions such as, “will a self-driving car decide in an emergency that it is best to kill the driver rather than kill a pregnant mother?” This is not the shocking wake-up call we are about to encounter. No, what you might find instead is that the autonomous grid chose to slaughter a raving lunatic dancing in the street because he was holding up traffic, and as such, was mathematically hurting society by way of the fact that his life is worth 500,000 units of currency, whereas the time and productivity lost by the thousands he is delaying amounts to 1,000,000 units of currency. Should we instead decide <em>not</em> to program self-driving vehicles with any logic more complex than, say, Isaac Asimov’s laws of robotics, we would likely find the entire autonomous grid grinding to a useless halt on a daily basis for the sake of saving a life. Such is the consequence of stopping the Infinite Trolley.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAWJJnQybZlk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAWJJnQybZlk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAWJJnQybZlk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/fa9580e0f1b8af06430fa40d6221a054/href">https://medium.com/media/fa9580e0f1b8af06430fa40d6221a054/href</a></iframe><p>On some level, I believe many of us realize we are fast becoming inefficient parties in the face of artificial intelligence. Science fiction movies where the robots have “deemed us expendable” give many people cause for concern, fleeting as the thought might be. However, we may find out all too soon that autonomous cars will have been the first salvo fired off by robots in such a future. We program them to understand our values. They make decisions that reflect our values. The decisions frighten us. What does that mean?</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@mitchturck/self-driving-cars-and-sound-cannons-an-indecent-proposal-43ebf99fafc">Read Part II here</a> for a practical approach to solving this problem, and chime in with your opinion.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*320_4I0lxbn5x3bx4XPI5Q.png" /></figure><p>Follow Backchannel: <a href="https://twitter.com/backchnnl"><em>Twitter</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Backchannel/1488568504730671"><em>Facebook</em></a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=85f3d1730756" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/reinventing-the-trolley-problem-85f3d1730756">A Self-Driving Car Might Decide You Should Die</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel">Backchannel</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> ]]>
